To generate the documentation PDF file:
1. You can either put your C# solution into the 'Input/src' folder or change 'ReadSolution' parameter in the config.wyam file
2. You can change the author and title of your document by changing the 'Pdf' parameters in the config.wyam file
3. You can change the logo on the cover of the generated PDF File by exchanging the 'logo.jpg' file or changing the last 'Pdf' parameter in the config.wyam file. You can also omit this parameter to generate a cover without any picture.
4. Run the wyam executable from 'Production' folder.
